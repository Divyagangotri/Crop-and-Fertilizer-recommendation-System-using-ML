# 🌾 Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System
## 📌 Project Overview
-- A web-based system that suggests the most suitable crops and fertilizers based on soil nutrients (NPK), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. It leverages machine learning models trained on real-time agricultural data to aid farmers in decision-making.

## 🎯 Objectives
-- Recommend the best crop to cultivate based on environmental and soil parameters.
-- Suggest the ideal fertilizer to ensure optimal crop growth and soil health.
-- Help farmers maximize yield and reduce costs.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
-- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
-- Backend: Python (Flask)
-- ML Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy

## Model: Random Forest Classifier
-- Dataset: Kaggle - Crop Recommendation & Fertilizer Dataset
## 🔍 Features
-- User-friendly input form to collect soil and weather parameters.
-- Machine learning model integration for prediction.
-- Real-time recommendation of both crops and fertilizers
-- Lightweight and responsive web interface.

## 📈 Model Performance
-- Accuracy (Crop Model): **~96%**
-- Accuracy (Fertilizer Model): **~94%**
-- Random Forest outperformed other models like Decision Trees and Logistic Regression in terms of accuracy.

## 💡 Future Improvements
-- Add location-based automatic data fetching (via APIs).
-- Include pest control suggestions.
-- Extend to mobile application for wider accessibility.
